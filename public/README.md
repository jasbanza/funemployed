# Online version of FUNemployed - Late To The Interview Edition
A very quick hacked together version of FUNemployed, mainly built as a way to re-learn javascript and jquery, as well as actually learn sass

## How to Play (hashed together from the official rule book)
The first player is chosen to start the game as the Employer. Everyone else starts as an Applicant.
The Applicants get 4 qualification cards each. 

Starting to the left of the Employer, each Applicant “interviews” by explaining why their qualifications make
them the best fit for the Job. Applicants reveal their Qualification Cards to the Employer, one at a time, and
describe how each one makes them qualified for the Job. **Because these cards are chosen at random and not revealed
to the player until they are flipped, the applicants have to think on their feet.** 

After all Applicants have had a turn, the Employer chooses which Applicant they feel is the most qualified and
gives the Job Card to that Applicant. The new employer is chosen and the cycle begins again.
